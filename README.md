# LLMOps: Building Real-World Applications With Large Language Models

## Overview

This repository provides a structured approach to LLMOps, covering various aspects of Large Language Model (LLM) development, deployment, evaluation, and safety considerations. It includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different LLM applications, fine-tuning techniques, evaluation strategies, and model monitoring.

## Repository Structure
